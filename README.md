## 🎤 Description

This project is a static clone of the Spotify landing page, showcasing my front-end development skills. It includes a simple artist search feature that uses a JSON file as a mock backend, displaying artist information such as name, genre, and image.  
The purpose of this project is to practice front-end development concepts and to build a functional, visually appealing landing page similar to Spotify.
